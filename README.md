Academic Management System (AMS) Backend API
The Academic Management System (AMS) API is a robust, multi-role backend solution designed to centralize and manage core institutional data, including user authentication, course enrollment, grade tracking, scheduling, and administrative reporting. Built on the Node.js platform, this API provides secure, high-performance endpoints for integration with web and mobile frontend applications.


üåü Features
‚Ä¢	Multi-Role Authentication: Secure login for Students, Teachers, and Administrators with role-based access control (RBAC).
‚Ä¢	Course Management: Full CRUD operations on courses, including automatic handling of enrollment caps and student waitlists.
‚Ä¢	Academic Records: Dedicated modules for logging and summarizing student attendance and entering/analyzing exam marks (including class averages).
‚Ä¢	Timetabling: Personalized timetable generation for students (based on enrollment) and teachers (based on courses taught).
‚Ä¢	Administrative Oversight: Centralized endpoints for managing student fees, support tickets, and system-wide announcements.
‚Ä¢	Scalable Architecture: RESTful design implemented with Node.js/Express and a flexible MongoDB schema.
